Jason Lengstorf has been very hard at work producing some great content for Learn With Jason.  Initially I was drawn in by the name, however I've been watching for at least the last 6 months or so and have frequently either wanted to try to implement things shown at work or elsewhere.  His work with Benaiah Mischenko reminded me that I had begun work on a Netlify CMS setup but had never published it.

The next obvious step was clearly to throw away my existing site / resume which had hardly been touched for many years.  Fingers crossed it all goes smoothly.  I'll update here about how things are going.
