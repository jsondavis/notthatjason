# Notthatjason

I've been using this as a resume site but it has stagnated for quite a while.
Also it seems high time to work on a project that is externally visible.


## Goals
- demonstrate the use of gatsby / react
- demonstrate frontend testing
- test out netlify deploy as oppoosed to zeit
- include a netlify contact form?
