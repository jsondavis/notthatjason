## SCBZ Microsites

When I began working at Scientific Games as part of the SCBZ group I was briefed about the nature of the sites but it didn't really hit until I was working through my first develoment cycle.  Our microsite "sprints" were typically a two week dev period where we would create a new themed website consisting of ~10 pages. Three or four of these pages needed true interactivity depending on the customer and the specific promotion or promotional art.

These microsites were created using a php backend and before I came to SG were written with html, jQuery and CSS.
