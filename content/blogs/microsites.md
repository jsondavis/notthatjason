## SCBZ Microsites

When I began working at Scientific Games as part of the SCBZ group I was briefed about the nature of the sites but it didn't really hit until I was working through my first develoment cycle.  Our microsite "sprints" were typically a two week dev period where we would create a new themed website consisting of ~10 pages. Three or four of these pages needed true interactivity depending on the customer and the specific promotion or promotional art.

These microsites were created using a php backend and before I joined the SCBZ team, were written with html, jQuery and CSS. Some great strides had been made by my Manager David Enete in creating a project template creator shortly before I joined the team. My first task as part of SCBZ before getting started with creating microsites myself was to create a gulpjs workflow to minify all of our javascript and css, and also to allow us to write styles using lesscss or sass which both allow for creation of much more complex style configurations but also allow for simplification of certain deeply nested styles.
